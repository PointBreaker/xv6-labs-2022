Q:Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
A:usertrap
Q:What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A:0x7, code of syscall for SYS_exec
Q:What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A:Machine mode.
Q:Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the varialable num?
A:80001ff6:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero), a3 is corresponds to the varialable num.
Q:Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
A:address 0 is not mapped in the kernel address space, scause value is 0xd, which corresponds to load page fault.
Q:What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
A:the name: initcode, pid: 1
